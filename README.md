# Sorry Analysis
Studies have found that, on average, an individual apologizes approximately 2,920 times every year. It is worth considering, of the 2,920 times we apologize, how many of those are actual apologies. Is an apology as simple as saying “sorry” or does one have to express regret? Is it necessary to give a lengthy explanation for it to be considered sincere? As language continues to develop, we have created new terms and phrases, both formal and informal, to express an apology. Because of this change and the subjectivity language holds, it can be difficult to uniformly identify an apology. Consider the following casual apology for an offense — “my bad” or “my fault”— taking into account culture, language and context, these phrases can hold different meanings. Although “sorry” is an apology lexeme, is it synonymous to an apology?

# Data Studied
A Kaggle Data Set of 1 million tweets was taken. On this dataset, we searched for terms that could belong in an apology and then we annotated the Tweets After. I built a python 
class and a python function to help with the annotations. There is also a function for Kohen's kappa which is important on understanding how well our annotaters agree.
